#Structures

###PDB files

The file 3o2g.pdb is a file that contains the crystal structure of the 
human [gamma-butyrobetaine 
dioxygenase](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3o2g "Link 
to Structure on PDB"). This structure was selected as a template for 
modelling the yeast ortholog which has an as yet unsolved structure.

YHL021.pdb contains the structural model of the yeast ortholog that was 
built based on 3o2g.pdb, using [SWISS-MODEL](http://swissmodel.expasy.org "Link 
to SWISS-MODEL homepage")

###py files

The files sequentially named catalytic are chimera sessions that were 
saved as snapshots when constructing the overlaid structure of the 
functional site as seen in Fig. 9B in the report.

###SWISS_MODEL_Report

A pdf report exported from SWISS MODEL after selecting a template and 
building a model based on it. This report contains quality assessment, 
statistics, and additional information about the modelling process.
