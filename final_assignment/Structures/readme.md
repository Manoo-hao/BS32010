###PDB files

The file 3o2g.pdb is a file that contains the crystal structure of the 
human gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase. This structure was selected as a 
template for modelling the yeast ortholog which has an as yet unsolved 
structure.

YHL021.pdb contains the structural model of the yeast ortholog that 
was built based on 3o2g.pdb.

###py files

The files sequentially named catalytic are chimera sessions that were 
saved as snapshots when constructing the overlaid structure at the 
functional site as seen in Fig. 9B in the report.
