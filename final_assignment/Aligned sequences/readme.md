#Aligned sequences

This folder contains aligned amino acid sequences after alignment with 
T-coffee Expresso. Each file is named after the yeast ortholog used for 
this particular alignment. The combined_homologs_aligned file contains 
all of the previous files copied into one file and were used for Fig. 8 
in the report.
